# Language Web

This sample module is one of two modules in the Shared Language Keys project
used to demonstrate how to share language keys using OSGi services. This
particular sample provides a simple JSP portlet with defined language keys. The
other module required for this demonstration is the
[`language`](../language) module.

For more details explaining how the `language` and
`language-web` modules function together, see the following
